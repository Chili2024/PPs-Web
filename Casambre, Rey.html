                    <h3>Profile</h3>
                    <p>On December 6, 2018, after attending a wake and having dinner with family, the spouses Casambre were stopped and surrounded by several vehicles while traveling to Cavite. Armed men then alighted and trained guns on their car, leading Rey to question if they were being arrested.

Upon asking for a warrant, Rey was shown a blurry photocopy of an alleged murder and attempted murder case. When he attempted to return to the car to speak to his wife and contact lawyers, he was pulled away. The men insisted that his wife also get out of the car, prompting Rey and Cora to question the reasons for her involvement.

Rey and Cora were threatened by the police and were forced to exit the car. They were then ordered to move towards a police car, and Rey's request to call his lawyers was denied. During the search, a pistol and other items were found and displayed to the barangay tanods. Despite Rey's protests, incriminating items were later found near their car.

The couple was taken to the CIDG NCR headquarters in Camp Crame and denied the opportunity to contact their family and lawyers. They were later examined by a doctor and refused to waive their rights during the inquest. The prosecutor resolved to set the case for regular preliminary investigation, and Cora Casambre was released on December 11, 2018. His case of Illegal Possession of Firerarms and Explosives filed in Cavite was dismissed; and after 5 years in detention, Rey Casambre was released on Febrruary 15, 2024, after posting bail for his case of attempted murder filed in a Davao court.</p>
